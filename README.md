# FreeSurfer Tutorial

Welcome to my FreeSurfer Tutorial repository! This repository contains scripts and data that I've compiled while working through the FreeSurfer software tutorial (https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/Tutorials).
FreeSurfer is a powerful software package for the analysis and visualization of structural and functional neuroimaging data from cross-sectional or longitudinal studies.

## Repository Contents

- **Scripts**: Contains various scripts used throughout the tutorial.
- **Data**: Includes example datasets provided by FreeSurfer or that I've generated during the tutorial process.
- **Documentation**: Additional notes and explanations
